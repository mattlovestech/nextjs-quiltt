## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a Next.js application using Quiltt for authentication.  The project structure is designed for scalability and maintainability.

## CODE STYLE
Adhere to standard TypeScript and Next.js best practices.  Consistent indentation and formatting are crucial.  Utilize Prettier for automatic formatting.

## FOLDER ORGANIZATION
The project follows a standard Next.js folder structure with additional folders for components, hooks, and generated code.  Refer to the project structure for details.

## TECH STACK
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Quiltt (for authentication)
- Tailwind CSS
- pnpm (package manager - installation instructions below)
- GraphQL (codegen.ts)


## PROJECT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS
- All components should be written in TypeScript.
- Use functional components where appropriate.
- Utilize hooks for state management and side effects.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES
- Use Git for version control.
- Follow semantic versioning for releases.
- Utilize a robust CI/CD pipeline (to be defined).


## REFERENCE EXAMPLES
- Refer to the Next.js documentation for best practices: [https://nextjs.org/docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) (Example link - replace with actual link if available)
- Quiltt Authentication Documentation (link to be added)


## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM
- All code should be well-documented.
- JSDoc style comments are preferred.
- Maintain a comprehensive README file.

## DEBUGGING
- Utilize the browser's developer tools for debugging.
- Leverage TypeScript's type system to catch errors early.

## FINAL DOs AND DON'Ts
- **DO** use pnpm for package management.
- **DO** commit frequently with clear commit messages.
- **DON'T** commit sensitive information (API keys, etc.).
- **DON'T** hardcode values; use environment variables instead.


### pnpm Installation Instructions:

For macOS (using Homebrew):
```bash
brew install pnpm
```

For Windows (using PowerShell):
```bash
iwr https://get.pnpm.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

For Linux:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

After installing pnpm, run:

```bash
cd quiltt-nextjs-template
pnpm install
```

Alternative package managers (npm and yarn) can be used by modifying commands in the README accordingly.  For example, using npm:
